## Overview

ImageIQ leverages the capabilities of the **Gemini 1.5 Flash model** to process images and generate intelligent, contextually relevant responses. From object recognition to scene understanding, ImageIQ is built to cater to a variety of image-based use cases with high accuracy and responsiveness.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Easily upload an image, and ImageIQ will process it and return relevant insights.
- **Responsive Analysis**: Using the Gemini model, ImageIQ provides accurate and meaningful responses for each image input.
- **Streamlined Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface built with Streamlit.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Powered by the Gemini 1.5 Flash model for optimized performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Streamlit**
- **Gemini API Access**: You’ll need access to the Gemini 1.5 Flash model API.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageIQ.git
    cd ImageIQ
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure your **Gemini API Key**:

   - Obtain your API key from the Gemini platform.
   - Store it as an environment variable or in a configuration file for secure access.

4. Run the app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## How to Use

1. **Upload an Image**: Drag and drop or select an image file to upload.
2. **Get Insights**: Once processed, ImageIQ will display the response generated by the Gemini 1.5 Flash model.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**: For the app's interactive interface.
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash Model**: Powers the core image analysis and response generation.
